              <h3>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3>

              <p>Cohesion Education, Inc. (hereafter called "Cohesion Education") provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. When using particular Cohesion Education services, you and Cohesion Education shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS.</p>

              <h3>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h3>

              <p>Cohesion Education currently provides users with a service to provide an online educational support platform and video library for parents of K-5 students wanting to proactively contribute to their child’s educational success. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augments or enhances the current Service, including the release of new Cohesion Education properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "as-is" and that Cohesion Education assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, misdelivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.</p>

              <p>In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the Internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the Internet, including a computer and modem or other access device.</p>

              <h3>3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h3>


              <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to access or use our Services. If you are under 18 years of age (or the age of legal majority where you live), you may only access or use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user in connection with our Services. If you are accessing or using our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity’s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or the other person or entity violates these Terms.</p>


              <p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Cohesion Education has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Cohesion Education has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).</p>

              <h3>4. MEMBERSHIP AND BILLING</h3>

              <p>Subscriptions</p>

              <p>You can find the specific details regarding your subscription with Cohesion Education at any time. Simply sign in to your Cohesion Education account, go to the Profile tab, and click manage your account.</p>

              <p>a. Billing</p>

              <p>By starting your Cohesion Education subscription, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you the subscription fee associated with the type of subscription (monthly or yearly) you chose during registration. You agree that we are authorized to charge you the subscription fee at the then-current rate to the Payment Method you provided during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change with notice. As used in these Terms of Service, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month or year thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription. Sign in to your Cohesion Education parent account, go to the Profile tab, and click Manage your account to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription. Subscription charges are fully earned upon payment.</p>

              <p>Note: In the event your monthly subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28.</p>

              <p>You acknowledge that the amount billed each billing period may vary for reasons that include differing amounts due to changes in your subscription plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by e-mail. If you want to use a different Payment Method or if there is a change in Payment Method, such as your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information from your Account management page. To access your Account management page sign in to your Cohesion Education account, go to the Profile tab, and click Manage your account. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you authorize us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>

              <p>b. Ongoing Subscription</p>

              <p>Your Cohesion Education subscription will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each billing period in order to avoid billing of the next subscription fee to your Payment Method. We will bill the subscription fee at the then-current rate plus any applicable tax to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment.</p>

              <p>c. Cancellation</p>

              <p>You may cancel your Cohesion Education subscription at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. You will continue to have access to the program until the current billing period ends. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partially used subscription periods. To cancel your subscription, sign in to your parent account and click the words "Cancel subscription" on your Account management page. Follow the instructions for cancellation under the heading "Cancel Subscription."</p>
